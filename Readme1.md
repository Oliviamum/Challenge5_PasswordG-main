Purpose of the project
All Challenge 5 documents are saved here in Challenge 5 Repository

Short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project: 
This project is part of the requirement for the fufillment of the bootcamp project. It is also a practice and demonstration of my understanding of application of Javascript to make things work in the webpage.

This challenge requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.
Although an interface is given of what is required, our task of using Javascrip is to make it work.
The following have been build in and working as expected:
Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

-Practically, this application can be used for security purposes for both individuals and organisations needing passcode to enter a premises/ building etc.

It is important for me to work on this project in preparation of building my own project for showcase to emplyers while seeking a job in front end web designing. The project requires me to display my skills and what i have learnt in making things work using Java Script.

Motivation? I am excited to continue learning html, CSS and Javascript. These are not only good for webdevelopment but they are skills when learnt will be used in a lot of different areas in academics and also business. I am also learning to become a web developer as these are essentials skills for it.

What i learnt? I learnt how to  write some codes in Javascrip and how to make things work.
